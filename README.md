# Web_Projects

This a simple repo to understand how to use HTML, CSS and Javascript in a responsive way.
All projects are based on the FreeCodeCamp.org Web Developer course.
Most of them increase in difficulty as I'm learning more and more about the web tecnologies.

Please let me know if any enhancements can be made to each project.
