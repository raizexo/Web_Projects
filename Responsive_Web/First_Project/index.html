    <h5><strong>Timeline of His Life</strong></h5>
    <ul class="text-left">
      <li><strong>January 15, 1929</strong>: Martin Luther King, Jr., is born Michael King, Jr., in Atlanta. His father is the pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church, a Black congregation in Atlanta. His mother is Alberta Williams King, a former schoolteacher. (In honor of the German religious reformer Martin Luther, the elder King later changes his name to Martin Luther King and his son’s name to Martin Luther King, Jr.) </li>
      <li><strong>1944</strong>: At age 15 King begins his freshman year at Morehouse College in Atlanta. He originally studies medicine and law but later decides to enter the ministry.</li>
      <li><strong>1948–55</strong>: King graduates from Morehouse College in 1948 with a bachelor’s degree in sociology. He spends the next three years at Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania. It is here that he first learns about Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy of nonviolence. Renowned for his public speaking skills, King is elected president of Crozer’s student body, which is composed almost entirely of white students. He is the valedictorian of his class in 1951. King then attends graduate school at Boston University. In Boston, King meets Coretta Scott. They are married in 1953. The following year King becomes pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. He receives a Ph.D. in theology from Boston University in 1955.</li>
      <li><strong>1955–56</strong>: In December 1955 King is chosen to head the Montgomery Improvement Association, formed by the Black community to lead a boycott of the segregated city buses. The boycott comes about after a Black woman named Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white man and was arrested. In response, King leads the Montgomery bus boycott. Late in 1956 the U.S. Supreme Court rules that segregation on buses is unconstitutional.</li>
      <li><strong>1957</strong>: King and other activists, notably Bayard Rustin, establish a group later known as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). It is formed to help local organizations carry out civil rights activities in the South.</li>
      <li><strong>1959</strong>: A visit to India gives King a long-awaited opportunity to study Gandhi’s techniques of nonviolent protest.</li>
    <li><strong>1960</strong>: King and his family move to his native city of Atlanta, where he becomes co-pastor, with his father, of the Ebenezer Baptist Church. At this post King devotes most of his time to the SCLC and the civil rights movement.</li>
    <li><strong>April 16, 1963</strong>: King writes what comes to be known as the “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” That spring King had participated in a campaign in Birmingham, Alabama, to end segregation at lunch counters and in hiring practices. Police had turned dogs and fire hoses on the protesters, and King had been arrested along with a large number of his supporters. In the Birmingham jail, King writes an open letter to his fellow clergymen explaining his philosophy of nonviolence and why he would continue to protest.</li>
  <li><strong>August 28, 1963</strong>: The historic March on Washington takes place. The march is organized by King and other civil rights leaders. More than 200,000 people participate in the demonstration. Near the Lincoln Memorial, in Washington, D.C., King delivers his famous “I Have a Dream” speech. The march influences the subsequent passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</li>
    <li><strong>October 14, 1964</strong>: King is announced as the winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace.</li>
