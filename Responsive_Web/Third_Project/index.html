            In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the
            presence or absence of prompts (>>> and …): to repeat the example,
            you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears;
            lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the
            interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an
            example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a
            multi-line command.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the
            interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with
            the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A
            comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or
            code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a
            string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to
            clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted
            when typing in examples.
          </p>
          <p>Some examples:</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
              # this is the first comment <br />
              spam = 1 # and this is the second comment <br />
              # ... and now a third! <br />
              text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."
            </code>

          <h2>Using Python as a Calculator</h2>
          <p>
            Let’s try some simple Python commands. Start the interpreter and
            wait for the primary prompt, <code>>>></code>. (It shouldn’t take
            long.)
          </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Numbers">
          <h3>Numbers</h3>
          <p>
            The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an
            expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is
            straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / work just like in most
            other languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (()) can be
            used for grouping. For example:
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
              >>> 2 + 2 <br />
              4 <br />
              >>> 50 - 5*6 <br />
              20 <br />
              >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4 <br />
              5.0 <br />
              >>> 8 / 5 # division always returns a floating point number <br />
              1.6 <br />
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type int, the ones with a
            fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type float. We will see more
            about numeric types later in the tutorial.
          </p>
          <p>
            Division (/) always returns a float. To do floor division and get an
            integer result (discarding any fractional result) you can use the //
            operator; to calculate the remainder you can use %:
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
              >>> 17 / 3 # classic division returns a float <br />
              5.666666666666667 <br />
              >>> <br />
              >>> 17 // 3 # floor division discards the fractional part <br />
              5 <br />
              >>> 17 % 3 # the % operator returns the remainder of the division
              <br />
              2 <br />
              >>> 5 * 3 + 2 # floored quotient * divisor + remainder <br />
              17 <br />
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            With Python, it is possible to use the ** operator to calculate
            powers :
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
              >>> 5 ** 2 # 5 squared <br />
              25 <br />
              >>> 2 ** 7 # 2 to the power of 7 <br />
              128 <br />
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            The equal sign (=) is used to assign a value to a variable.
            Afterwards, no result is displayed before the next interactive
            prompt:
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
              >>> width = 20 <br />
              >>> height = 5 * 9 <br />
              >>> width * height <br />
              900 <br />
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>If a variable is not “defined” (assigned a value), trying to use it will give you an error:</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
                >>> n  # try to access an undefined variable <br>
                Traceback (most recent call last): <br>
                  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module> <br>
                NameError: name 'n' is not defined <br>
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>There is full support for floating point; operators with mixed type operands convert the integer operand to floating point:</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
                >>> 4 * 3.75 - 1 <br>
14.0 <br>
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>In interactive mode, the last printed expression is assigned to the variable _. This means that when you are using Python as a desk calculator, it is somewhat easier to continue calculations, for example:</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
                >>> tax = 12.5 / 100 <br>
>>> price = 100.50 <br>
>>> price * tax <br>
12.5625 <br>
>>> price + _ <br>
113.0625 <br>
>>> round(_, 2) <br>
113.06 <br>
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>This variable should be treated as read-only by the user. Don’t explicitly assign a value to it — you would create an independent local variable with the same name masking the built-in variable with its magic behavior.</p>
        <p>In addition to int and float, Python supports other types of numbers, such as Decimal and Fraction. Python also has built-in support for complex numbers, and uses the j or J suffix to indicate the imaginary part (e.g. 3+5j).</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Strings"><h3>Strings</h3>
        <p>Besides numbers, Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result. \ can be used to escape quotes:</p>
        <div class="code">
            <code>
                >>> 'spam eggs'  # single quotes <br>
                'spam eggs' <br>
                >>> 'doesn\'t'  # use \' to escape the single quote... <br>
                "doesn't" <br>
                >>> "doesn't"  # ...or use double quotes instead <br>
                "doesn't" <br>
                >>> '"Yes," they said.' <br>
                '"Yes," they said.' <br>
                >>> "\"Yes,\" they said." <br>
                '"Yes," they said.' <br>
                >>> '"Isn\'t," they said.' <br>
                '"Isn\'t," they said.' <br>
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>In the interactive interpreter, the output string is enclosed in quotes and special characters are escaped with backslashes. While this might sometimes look different from the input (the enclosing quotes could change), the two strings are equivalent. The string is enclosed in double quotes if the string contains a single quote and no double quotes, otherwise it is enclosed in single quotes. The print() function produces a more readable output, by omitting the enclosing quotes and by printing escaped and special characters:</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
                >>> '"Isn\'t," they said.' <br>
'"Isn\'t," they said.' <br>
>>> print('"Isn\'t," they said.') <br>
"Isn't," they said. <br>
>>> s = 'First line.\nSecond line.'  # \n means newline <br>
>>> s  # without print(), \n is included in the output <br>
'First line.\nSecond line.' <br>
>>> print(s)  # with print(), \n produces a new line <br>
First line. <br>
Second line. <br>
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>If you don’t want characters prefaced by \ to be interpreted as special characters, you can use raw strings by adding an r before the first quote:</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
                >>> print('C:\some\name')  # here \n means newline! <br>
                C:\some <br>
                ame <br>
                >>> print(r'C:\some\name')  # note the r before the quote <br>
                C:\some\name  <br>
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>String literals can span multiple lines. One way is using triple-quotes: """...""" or '''...'''. End of lines are automatically included in the string, but it’s possible to prevent this by adding a \ at the end of the line. The following example:</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
                print("""\ <br>
Usage: thingy [OPTIONS] <br>
     -h                        Display this usage message <br>
     -H hostname               Hostname to connect to <br>
""") <br>
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>produces the following output (note that the initial newline is not included):</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
                Usage: thingy [OPTIONS] <br>
     -h                        Display this usage message <br>
     -H hostname               Hostname to connect to <br>
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>Strings can be concatenated (glued together) with the + operator, and repeated with *:</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>
                >>> # 3 times 'un', followed by 'ium' <br>
                >>> 3 * 'un' + 'ium' <br>
                'unununium' <br>
            </code>
